              <p>First blog post. I will be talking about the state of my Fishing Game project.</p>

              <p>It's a bit weird that my first status report it's for an already started project but it is what it is. Currently I'd say it's maybe 70% done, I just have to finish the
                collection book, draw sprites (will take a LOT of time), some final touches and upload it to, I guess, amazon lightsail. But even tho I'm close to finish it wont be
                ready in a short period of time (I just dont have a lot of free time). 
              </p>

              <p>The last thing I did was for the collection book, It took more time that I expected but I managed to get the number of available fishes and display a div for each one.

              <p>Each white strip is a fish. Next step is to divide the fishes in groups so I don't have +50 fishes in a tiny square. After that i'll work on the actual catched fish info
                (simply fish sprite, name and max length). How I'll do that? I don't know. 
              </p>

              <p>I'm thinking about how to do it while writing this post. I will first get the number of page, simply dividing number of fishes by the fishes I want per page,
                then i'll just place all pages on top of eachothers. The selected one will be shown, the others will be hidden. Sounds right for me, next post will be testing 
                what I've just said.
